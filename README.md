## Backstory: Why We Built This Project

In the early stages of our project, one of our teammates was browsing through Behance, searching for design inspiration. It was during this exploration that she stumbled upon a case study that left her deeply unsettled. The study revealed a disheartening truth: lesbian women, due to a misconception, were not using protection as frequently as they would when engaging in sexual activities with men. This alarming revelation shook us to our core and ignited a passionate drive within us to make a difference.

We delved deeper into this issue, driven by a burning curiosity to understand why such a misconception existed. Through extensive research, we uncovered a pattern that echoed across different parts of the world. The lack of proper education and training among healthcare professionals to address the unique sexual orientations and needs of the LGBTQ+ community played a significant role in perpetuating this misunderstanding.

The social stigma attached to discussing sexual health openly further compounded the problem. Many LGBTQ+ individuals felt hesitant and fearful of seeking out resources and information that could empower them to make informed decisions about their sexual well-being. This combination of limited access to healthcare professionals who were knowledgeable about LGBTQ+ sexual health and the prevailing societal reluctance to openly discuss these topics posed a serious threat to the physical and mental well-being of countless individuals within the community.

Motivated by our newfound awareness and fueled by a shared passion for promoting equality and inclusivity, we set out on a mission to build a safe space for the LGBTQ+ community to explore and discuss sexual health. Our aim is to bridge the gap between inadequate healthcare support and the vital need for accurate information and resources. We firmly believe that every individual, regardless of their sexual orientation, deserves access to comprehensive sexual health education, support, and resources.

With this project, we aspire to create a platform that not only addresses the specific concerns and experiences of LGBTQ+ individuals but also fosters a sense of belonging, acceptance, and empowerment. Our ultimate goal is to ensure that no one within the LGBTQ+ community feels alone or left in the dark when it comes to their sexual health. We believe that by providing accurate information, fostering open dialogue, and promoting safe practices, we can contribute to the physical and mental well-being of the community we hold dear.
